# Trinsic Web UI Client

# Usage

The library exports three methods: `launchIframe(launchUrl)`, `launchPopup(launchUrl)` and `launchRedirect(launchUrl, redirectUrl)`.

Depending on how you would like your user interaction to be, an embedded iFrame, a popup or a redirect flow, choose your start point.

You can retrieve the launch url from a trusted backend that can reach out to the Trinsic servers. See our backend language examples.
