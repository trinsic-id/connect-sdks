# Python SDK Sample

This simple application demonstrates how to set up the Trinsic SDK to start verification flows and read their results. It sets 4 server endpoints that an UI application can call
to launch verifications.

## Dependencies

- [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id): Our API library that makes it easy to start accepting digital IDs in your application
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/): Pydantic is the most widely used data validation library for Python.
- [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv): Reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables.

## Setup

At this repository's root run `npm ci`. This sample depends on the `ui-web` sample. It serves static files generated by that application. So before you run this, make sure to run `npm run build` inside the
[`ui-web/samples`](../../ui-web/samples/) folder.

### Running the project

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.

Create a new `.env` file to set your Trinsic Access Token. You can use [`example.env`](./example.env) as a reference. If you need more information where to find this token, visit our [Getting Started](https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/getting-started-with-trinsic-connect) guide.

After you created your `.env` file you are good to run the project.

```sh
python main.py
```
