# Go SDK Sample

This simple application demonstrates how to set up the Trinsic SDK to start verification flows and read their results. It sets 4 server endpoints that an UI application can call
to launch verifications.

## Dependencies

- [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id): Our API library that makes it easy to start accepting digital IDs in your application
- [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/): A Go web framework built on top of Fasthttp
- [godotenv](https://github.com/tonerdo/dotnet-env): A minimal dependency to autoload `.env` files into the environment's variables

## Setup

At this repository's root run `npm ci`. This sample depends on the `ui-web` sample. It serves static files generated by that application. So before you run this, make sure to run `npm run build` inside the
[`ui-web/samples`](../../ui-web/samples/) folder.

### Running the project

Create a new `.env` file to set your Trinsic Access Token. You can use [`example.env`](./example.env) as a reference. If you need more information where to find this token, visit our [Getting Started](https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/getting-started-with-trinsic-connect) guide.

After you created your `.env` file you are good to run the project

```sh
# Running:
go run main.go

# Building:
go build -o sample && ./sample
```

## Support

New features and bug fixes are released on the latest major version of our packages. If you are on an older major version, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest in order to use the new features and bug fixes including those for security vulnerabilities. Older major versions of the package will continue to be available for use, but will not be receiving any updates.
